//STUFF to add to the Report later

We started by building the Express + Handlebars base project inside solution/frontend/.
This allows us to develop and test the UI immediately and progressively integrate the API later.
Handlebars was chosen because it provides logic-less templating, automatically integrates with Express, and keeps the frontend simple.


For the frontend we should not upload the node_modules folder.
Instead, when we run it on another device we should run npm install.
