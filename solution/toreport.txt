Some conda commands:

conda env list
conda activate geopandas_env
conda install -c conda-forge seaborn

BEFORE delivering the project, we can export the conda environment so that 
the lecturer could have the same modules installed and ready to execute
//on our side
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
//on the other side
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geopandas_env
