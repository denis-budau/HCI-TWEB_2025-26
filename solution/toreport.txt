Some conda commands:

conda env list
conda activate geopandas_env
conda install -c conda-forge seaborn
conda install conda-forge::geopandas //actually not needed in our project, we use plotly express choropleth instead (that contains the map shape files already)


BEFORE delivering the project, we can export the conda environment so that 
the lecturer could have the same modules installed and ready to execute
//on our side
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
//on the other side
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geopandas_env


#router in flask is not required in the assignment BUT we could add it in the assignment for sophisticated data
so we can have more points :)

e.g. we could have an "Insight" page on the web page with plots and stuff, and write our story there
